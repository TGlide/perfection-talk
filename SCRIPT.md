# Introduce crappy software

As a technologist, it is surprising how much I am frustrated by technology. I see the immense value it provides, in a myriad of applications that my peers, friend, and family use daily. But I also feel that I'm not alone in this frustration, regardless of how useful someone gauges the products that they use.

Picture this:

_Show frames of examples_

- You go to a website looking for a recipe, and you need to register, go through a cookie pop-up, and through someone's life-story
- You try and talk to support, and you're greeted with a bot who's actually a glorified form
- You click on a checkbox some times, and the website still notifies you about that 1 minute later, in a place far away
- You try and open the page you've just been to, and are greeted with loading screens
- You update an issue on GitHub, and have to reload because the website's data is conflicting. That's why IT folks keep asking you to turn it off and on again.
- No words needed here.
- You go use a product you used to love, only to discover it started putting basic features behind a paywall.

_Finish by grabbing all images and putting them in the trash, emil Kowalski animation style_

If you're like me, I can feel your mind banging against the walls in anger over scenarios you've seen one too many times. These patterns are common, and it may seem nitpicky that I'm making a big fuss over it. Most things in life are not smooth-edged, and we all just kinda have to make do with what we've got.

But I'm personally not comfortable with that. I think humanity is at its best when we strive to make things a little bit better, one step at a time.

# Introduce myself

My name is Thomas G. Lopes, I'm a front-end engineer at Hugging Face, and an open-source maintainer, and today I want to discuss how we can try and do just that.

Now, I believe there's one thing in common that makes us all qualified to create good software. Using the bad ones. And if you write bad code, like I mostly do, even better.
