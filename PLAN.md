## Intro

As a technologist, it is surprising how much I am frustrated by technology. I see the immense value it provides, in a myriad of applications that my peers, friend, and family use daily. But I also feel that I'm not alone in this frustration, regardless of how useful someone gauges the products that they use.

Picture this:

_Show flashes of poor UX_

- You go to a website looking for a recipe, and you need to register, go through a cookie pop-up, and through someone's life-story
- You try and talk to support, and you're greeted with a bot who's actually a glorified form
- Youtube's form thing with toasts/cryptic toasts
- You try and open the page you've just been to, and are greeted with loading screens

_Finish by grabbing all images and putting them in the trash, emil Kowalski animation style_

If you're like me, I can feel your mind banging against the walls in anger over scenarios you've seen one too many times. These patterns are common, and it may seem nitpicky that I'm making a big fuss over it. Most things in life are not smooth-edged, and we all just kinda have to make do with what we've got.

But I'm personally not comfortable with that. I think humanity is at its best when we strive to make things a little bit more closer to perfection, one step at a time.

My name is Thomas G. Lopes, I'm a front-end engineer at Hugging Face, and an open-source maintainer, and today I want to discuss how we can try and do just that.
